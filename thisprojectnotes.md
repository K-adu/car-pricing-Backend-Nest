### what are we doing in this project

to create a user controller that saves users password and email in the database

we first send the requet from postman
then we applied validation pipe

then we created a dtos

then we went to user service

typeorm creates own repo after we create the userentity

then on user service we import different things we can use
lile reposityory from the type orm
then injestrepository

we then used dependecny injection and creayed a constructor that will execute whenever the function objecr is created

then we callled the repo prorties create and save

after that we went to user controller and we used the same dependecnt injectipn techniqur to call the userservie
